# Parallel_Computing_MPI
Examples from selected topics of the William Gropp's book, reworked and all of them written in C programming language.

The repository contains the implementation of the examples that are given during the course of Parallel computing in New Bulgarian University. The main book that is used in the course is:
William Gropp, Ewing Lusk, and Anthony Skjellum. 2014. Using MPI: Portable Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing Interface. The MIT Press.

The examples from the book are reworked, the style of programs is changed. Some examples that originally are given in Fortran the book are rewritten in C programming language. Also, Open MPI is used to run and test the programs.

The topics covered are:
1. Introduction to parallel programming using MPI. Environment for implementation of MPI programs.
2. Basic concepts of parallel computing using MPI.
3. Data types.
4. Collective messages.
5. Point-to-point communication: blocking and non-blocking messages.
6. MPI input and output.

Technical requirements:
- Operating System: Linux distribution (for example Ubuntu Linux);
- Compilers: GCC;
- MPI implementation: Open MPI;
- Programming languages: both C and C++.
